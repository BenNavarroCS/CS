- dicts loop in the order the keys were created, to stop this use a for loop and manipulate the keys in the loop. One way of doing this is for key in sorted(dict.keys())
- You can nest lists inside dicts with key : [list], don't nest too deeply
- you can nest dicts in dicts with dict = {key : {key : value}}, where the first key is the name for the dict
