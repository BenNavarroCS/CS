- dict[key] = value --- adds another key and value pair to the dictionary, you can also swap values for a key this way
- del dict[key] --- completely removes a kay and value pair from a dict
- .get() --- used when a key in a dict might not exist, does not raise a KeyError
- for key, value in dict.items(): --- loops through key and value pair and in this example assigns the key to key and value to value and prints for each key and value pair
- for key in dict.keys(): --- loops but for keys only, the same output is achieved with for keys in dict:
